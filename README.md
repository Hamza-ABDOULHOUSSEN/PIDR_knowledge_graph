# PIDR_knowledge_graph

This projet as for objectives to develop an algorithm to pass from knowledge graph throught ontonlogy. At the end, we should be able to write a scientific article. Plus, if we have time, we will improve some algorithms that already exist.

# tools and langage uses 

Our programation langage we use will be Python. For mor simplicity, we will use english in the entire project.
