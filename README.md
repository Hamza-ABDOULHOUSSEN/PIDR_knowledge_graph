# 1. PIDR_knowledge_graph

This projet as for objectives to develop an algorithm to pass from knowledge graph throught ontonlogy. At the end, we should be able to write a scientific article. Plus, if we have time, we will improve some algorithms that already exist.

## 1.1. tools and langage uses 

Our programation langage we use will be Python. For mor simplicity, we will use english in the entire project.

## 1.2. content

### 1.2.1. Meeting minutes
This folder contains all the meeting minutes

### 1.2.2. [Python insertion test](Python%20insertion%20test)
this folder contains the python script to add match in the ontology

### 1.2.3. Chess Ontology.owl
This is the ontology test created about chess knowledge
