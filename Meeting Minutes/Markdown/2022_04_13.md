## 1.1. Agenda
1. Review of the work


## 1.2. Review of the work
We have seen with Mariano the probleme of constraints. Maybe to start, we don't have to infer all the information, but try to put the constraints in the knowledge graphs so that an interpreter can read and understand the constraints on the file. Besides, we have also seen the state of the art on the article, we have to focus on the main points because it is not possible to explain ontologies and knowledge graph in on month.

## 1.3. Tasks
- Finish the example
- Try to extract a constraint
- Continue the article
