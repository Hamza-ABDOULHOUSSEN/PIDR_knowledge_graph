## 1.1. Progress
- Recreated some ontology classes to make them more easy to understand
- Try some ontology visualization tools


## 1.2. Agenda
1. presentation of the ontology changes
2. show ontology visualization tools


## 1.3. Presentation of the ontology changes
We tried to simplify the ontology, remove information in names, remove description in classes in order
to make it easier to read for machines.
To do so, we :
- Deleted the individuals
- Replaced Pieces name
- Added Sides as Data property
- Created cells
- Removed movement description


## 1.4. Show ontology visualization tools
It is possible to create an ontology with prot g  via the Window/Tabs menu and OWLViz tool.  
However, there are only the classes and the subclasses links.  
It is possible to add the VOWL plugin by adding a jar in the correct directory.  
It allows at complete visualization with object and data properties.  
[Here is the documentation of VOWL](http://vowl.visualdataweb.org/protegevowl.html)

## 1.5. Tasks
- Search how to make conditions
- Use ontology with python
- Try to make SparkSQL request
