## 1.1. Agenda
1. Advance on the constraints
2. Advance on the script
3. Advance on the article


## 1.2. Advance on the constraints
Killian looked on articles for a way to describe logic description like `some`. With that description, we
have to make an interpreter that can parse and understand the logic into the file.

## 1.3. Advance on the script
With an example of `rdf` triples find [here](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lapalme/ForestInsteadOfTheTrees/HTML/ch07s01.html), we created a template and we are using this template to write the triples extracted into an `rdf` file.

## 1.4. Advance on the article
Hadrien was summarizing the articles we have on the ontology and the knowledge graph for the state of art of our article.

## 1.5. Tasks
- Finish the example
- Try to extract a constraint
- Continue the article
