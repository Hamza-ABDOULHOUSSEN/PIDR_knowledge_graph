## 1.1. Progress
- Update the script to extract properties from ontology
- Begin some tests


## 1.2. Agenda
1. Review of the progress
2. Work at the lab
3. Reasoner engine
4. Constraints
5. Informations

## 1.3. Review of the progress
We have showed to Mario and Mariano our progress on the extraction of data from `owl` files and
how we used the `Neo4j` tools.


## 1.4. Work at the lab
During the work session :
- Hadrien started the article, He looked for the reglementation of scientific articles and started
the main structure and the table of contents of the article.
The article will be in **English** so that Mariano can understand it and give us his feedbacks.
- Hamza improved the `python` script to extract the individuals. He also tried to get small ontologies
to make more tests and try it with different files.
- Killian looked for the `Neo4j` and `neosemantics` code. `Neo4j` is open source, the idea was to
convert the ontology so we can see the graph on `Neo4j` and to understand how was the data
imported and converted into graphs.
Then, he searched for creating graphs with `python` from `rdf` files.

## 1.5. Reasoner engine
There are two ways to add inferred information.
We can use the ontology engine and try to convert the data into triples for knowledge graphs.  
The other way is to extract basic informationin from ontologies and guess the relation with the graph.  
First, we will try to extract the information inferred by the ontology engine.

## 1.6. Constraints
The next step for us is to convert ontologies constraints. We have to think about knowledge graph triples representation for ontologies constraints.  
For example :

## 1.7. Information
Mario also aware us, he will not be present from April 8th to May 10th.

## 1.8. Tasks
- Make a leaf project for the article (check if Mariano has access to the school leaf)
- Create ontologies and use them to make tests
- Continue the article

## 1.9. Next meeting
[April 06th 2022](2022_04_06.md)

## 1.10. Go back to all mettings
