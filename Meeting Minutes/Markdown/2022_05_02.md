## 1.1. Agenda
1. Search for constraints representation
2. Reasoner
3. Add command flags and arguments
4. Advance on the article


## 1.2. Search for constraints representation
We have looked for the actual representation of semantics in Knowledge Graph to find a way to represent constraints in the Knowledge Graph

## 1.3. Reasoner
We have seen that the `owlready2` package can use the `HermitT` reasoner. We added to the script a method to use the reasoner and save the inferred information

## 1.4. Add command flags and arguments
We have made the script generic by adding flags and arguments.  
We can use flags to input the owl file and insert the output. Here is the complete description.  

```
DESCRIPTION

     -i      [required] [need argument] it is to add the owl input file path
             by default, the output is the input with '_output'
             ex : -i "resource/pizza.owl"  
             
         
     -o      [need argument] add the output file path
             ex : -o "output/pizza"  
             

     -O      [need argument] same as -O but overwrite the file if already exists
             ex : -O "output/pizza"      
             

     -p      To print the triple added
     

     -s      To create standard triple without restrictions
     
     -r      To add reasoner before
     

     -kr     [need argument] To keep the ontology made after the reasoner
             the argument is the path of the new file
             ex : -kr "reasoner/pizza.owl" 
             
             
     -Kr     [need argument] same as -kr but overwrite the file if already exists
             ex : -Kr "reasoner/pizza.owl"
```

## 1.5. Advance on the article
We completed the article by explaining the concepts added in the Chess ontology and the issues we have met.

## 1.6. Tasks
- Try to get a visualisation from the `rdf` file
- Continue the article
