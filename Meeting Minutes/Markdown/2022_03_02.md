## 1.2. Agenda
1. complete the chess ontology
2. `Neo4j` for knowledge graph


## Complete the chess ontology
To represent conditions, we could use an object property presents which link a Match_move to the
condition it presents. For the condition, we use a class with annotation to describe the condition (for exemple, check : when the king is threatened).  
We will also complete annotation for every class.


## Neo4j for knowledge graph
We should investigate on `Neo4j` to reprensent knowledge graph. The idea is to discover it
We can after see if we could use python class to make it easier to use.


## 1.7. Tasks
- Complete the ontology (condition, annotation)
- Investigate on `Neo4j`
