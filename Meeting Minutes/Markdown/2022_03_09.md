## 1.1. Progress
- Finished the ontology
- Created project on `Neo4j`
- Tried to load the ontology on `Neo4j`


## 1.2. Agenda
1. Presentation of the ontology
2. Presentation of a graph on `Neo4j`
3. Issue to load ontologies on `Neo4j`
4. Explain the python script to write on the ontology to Mario
5. Explain the scrypt to load ontology and create python object


## 1.3. Presentation of the ontology
We presented completely the ontology, each objects for the pieces, the cells, the side, the conditions
and we showed the modelisation of a match and the moves in the match.


## 1.4. Presentation of a graph on `Neo4j`
We have seen we can create graphs on Neo4j with `cypher` file (looks like `json` file). Maybe we can
generate a `cypher` file with ontologies to create the graph on `Neo4j`.

## 1.5. Issue to load ontologies on `Neo4j`
We are also learning to load ontologies on `Neo4j`, it is not working correctly and we have to adapt it
for multilinks.

## 1.6. Explain the python script to write on the ontology to Mario
We showed to Mario how does the script to add match on ontologies works.

## 1.7. Explain the scrypt to load ontology and create python object
We presented the owlready package to read the objects on ontologies and how we can do `SPARQL` to
query the ontology.

## 1.8. Tasks
- Review the script to load ontologies to generate triple for subclasses
- Prepare a presentation on Neo4j and explain its strengths

## 1.9. Next meeting
[March 16th 2022](2022_03_16.md)

## 1.10. Go back to all mettings
