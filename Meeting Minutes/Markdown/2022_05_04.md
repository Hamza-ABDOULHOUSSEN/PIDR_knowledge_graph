## 1.1. Agenda
1. Go back to owl
2. Graph visualisation
3. Advance on the article

## 1.2. Go back to owl
We started to go from `rdf` file to ontology `owl`. For that we tried to get from `rdf` files all the triples.

## 1.3. Graph visualisation
We use the `dot` language to create a graph from triples. In `python`, we used the package `graphviz`,
It allows to create a graph, add nodes and edges. The script generate a `gv` file in `dot` and it is possible
to convert them to png using the dot command. The bashscript `convert_all_to_png.sh` convert all the files into png with the command `./convert_all_to_png.sh`.  
However, when the file is too large, the picture is hard to read and cut for the largest files.

## 1.4. Advance on the article
For the article, we had the element of the Chess Ontology and the beginning of the explication of the script.

## 1.5. Tasks
- Go from rdf to owl
- Continue the article
