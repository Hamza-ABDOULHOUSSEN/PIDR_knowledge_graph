## 1.2. Work at the lab
During the work session, Hadrien made progress on the report and did research for the state of art.
Killian and Hamza tried to look how to convert ontology constraints to knowledge graphs. They
looked on the internet how to represent constraints on knowlegde graphs and they focused on the
constraints `some` to try to make an example.

## 1.3. Information
For the next two weeks, Hadrien, Killian and Hamza are in holidays. So they asked to do the meetings
online on google teams, if possible.  
For the leaf project, Mariano does not have access to the
school leaf server and on the basic leaf, free user can only share their projects to one person.
