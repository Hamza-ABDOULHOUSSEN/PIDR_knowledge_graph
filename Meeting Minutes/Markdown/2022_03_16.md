## 1.1. Progress
- Update the script to get a set of triples
- Load our ontology on `Neo4j`


## 1.2. Agenda
1. Presentation of the `Neo4j` graph made with the ontology
2. Presentation of the triples generated with the python script
3. Informations and advices

## 1.3. Presentation of the Neo4j graph made with the ontology
We have follow the instruction this link to import our ontology into `Neo4j`. We had to click on `Raw` on github to load it with the link on `Neo4j`. However, the constraints are not on the graph.


## 1.4. Presentation of the triples generated with the `python` script
We have also updated the `python` script, it generate the `python` object but also complete a list with
triples corresponding to (class, SUBCLASSOF, class). First, we have to check that all subclasses are
in the list and then we could create new triples for the others data properties.

## 1.5. Informations and advices
Dr Mario gave information about a possible internship after to finish the project. Besides, the defence
of the project will happen on Monday, May 23th since the lab members of the jury will have to
go to a conference. Dr Mario, also advised us to start the report because we could be short on time
at the end.

## 1.6. Tasks
- Go ahead on `Neo4j` and try to add properties and constraints
- Make tests for the script and try to generate more triples with data properties

## 1.7. Next meeting
[March 23th 2022](2022_03_23.md)
