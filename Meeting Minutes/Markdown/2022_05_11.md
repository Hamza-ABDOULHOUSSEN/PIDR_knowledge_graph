## 1.1. Agenda
1. Correction of the main classes
2. Create the ontology from the `rdf` file
3. Advance on the article

## 1.2. Correction of the main classes
To get all classes, for the main classes, we had this triple :  
`("main_classe", "SubclassOf", "Thing")`

## 1.3. Create the ontology from the rdf file
We advanced on the other script to convert the `rdf` file into `owl` ontology. The script get the classes, subclasses, individuals and properties. the output generated is an `owl` ontology and it is read by `protégé`

## 1.4. Advance on the article
On the article, we are adding element to define ontologies and knowledge graphs. We will add more details for the script and all the differents visualisations we get.
