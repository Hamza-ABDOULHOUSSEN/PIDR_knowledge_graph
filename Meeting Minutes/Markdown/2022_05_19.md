## 1.2. Review on the presentation
We have shown the slides to Mariano and presented him the main element of the presentation.
Mariano advised us to :

- present quickly the reasoner as engine which used logic to infer data
- add the restriction presented (page 11)
- explain not deeply ontologies in the schema (owl/rdf/rdfs/Turtle) and knowledge graphs in
the only schema (rdf)
- for the output made by the python structure, compared it to protégé
- conclusion : summarize the work done and present what we learned during the project
